Ryn is a cross-platform rhythm game, inspired by [osu! mania](https://github.com/ppy/osu), [Etterna](https://github.com/etternagame/etterna), [Stepmania](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania) and [Dance Dance Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution). It is aimed at keyboard players, although a mobile version is set to release sometime in the future. The developement of the game is still in progress.
